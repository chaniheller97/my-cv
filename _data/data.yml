       In the two years that served as a lone soldier in the army, I developed a REST API connecting a PLM system to websites that we built. The API was written in dotnet 6 and made use of unit testing and had a ci/cd which made use of Docker and gitlab runners. The Website I built is written in react. And Excepted for developing new systems I also helped maintain old systems written in a plethora of frameworks and languages.
